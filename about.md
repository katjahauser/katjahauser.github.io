Hi, I'm Katja. 

You can find a more formal, research oriented "About" on the starting page of this website. 

I am a computer scientist by training (I have an M.Sc. in Applied Computer Science to be precise), who is interested in many-a-thing. 

Using the opportunity of having to have an application subject, comparable to a minor, in my degree (it's *Applied* Computer Science, after all ;) ) I dabbled into Economics and later Slavic Studies with Russian as a language.

I am a mother to a little daughter, who I call Alice on this website. (I did mention I'm a computer scientist, didn't I?) Thanks to her, I currently spend a reasonable amount of time crawling around in the flat and on playgrounds, yay <3

In my spare time (yes, it exists) I like to go ballroom dancing with my husband and bouldering without him. I got into sewing after having Alice, which is now filling my cozy lockdown evenings.
