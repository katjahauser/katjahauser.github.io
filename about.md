Hi, I'm Katja. 

You can find a more formal, research oriented "About" on the [main page](index.md) of this website. 

I am a computer scientist, who is interested in many-a-thing. 

Using the opportunity of having to have an application subject, comparable to a minor, in my degree (*Applied* Computer Science) I dabbled into Economics and later Slavic Studies with Russian as a language.

I am mother to a little daughter. In my spare time I like to go ballroom dancing with my husband and bouldering/climbing, if the pandemic permits. I got into sewing to fill my cozy lockdown evenings and happily stuck with it.
