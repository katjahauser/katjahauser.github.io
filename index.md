Hi, my name is Katja Hauser. 

I am a PhD student in computer science at [Visual Learning Lab](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/) at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en). 

Currently, I am working on RNA basecalling with a focus on the identification of modified bases. 

I am interested in: 
 + invertible neural networks 
 + the [Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635) and follow-up work
 + uncertainty quantification

My CV can be found [here](/assets/2020-07_CV_internet.pdf). 

You can find me on [github](https://github.com/katjahauser/). I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/katjahauser) on which you will find tweets about my work, papers and articles I find interesting and some occasional joke.
