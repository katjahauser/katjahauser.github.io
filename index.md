Hi, my name is Katja Hauser. 

I finished my master's thesis in Applied Computer Science at [Visual Learning Lab](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/) ([Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en)) in December 2019. 

Currently, I am working as independent researcher. I am interested in understanding the structures that arise in neural networks during training. Specifically, I want to study the networks uncovered by the [Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03635) with topological methods. 

I have previously worked with: 
 + invertible normalizing flows, specifically the [Invertible Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04730) (INN) 
 + ensembles and ensemble based uncertainty quantification (specifically [Deep Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01474))

My CV can be found [here](/assets/2021-02_CV.pdf). 

You can find me on [github](https://github.com/katjahauser/). I also have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/katjahauser), if you like to follow me there. I post notifications about my work there and occasionally retweet articles I find interesting or make some joke.
